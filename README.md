C++ code to convert a TGA image into line segments using Marching Squares.

Code produces both curvature-based and box-counting dimension.

See figure1.tga for a sample Mandelbrot set (taken from http://paulbourke.net/fractals/mandelbrot/), where:
<br>
Curvature-based dimension: 1.16316
<br>
Box-counting dimension:    1.39349

Also see cat.tga (it's cute), and small_mandelbrot.tga or smalldot.tga (especially easy to visualize, using OpenGL) for more sample images.
